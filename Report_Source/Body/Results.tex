\section{Results}
This section presents and discusses the experiments and their results.\\

\subsubsection{Single Thread Execution}
Table 1 shows the results of the median filter speeds and Figure 1 shows the images and figure 2 shows the outputs\\
\newline
It was successfully predicted that the insertion sort would be the quickest. This is due to insertion sort operating extremely well in cases where the dataset is small. If the mask was increased and thus the dataset grew. the sort is expected to take exponential longer due it's intrinsic $N^2$ growth rate. std::sort is under-performing due to the dataset being too small, as the mask gets larger, this sort is expected to dominate in performance.

\subsubsection{Multi-Threaded Execution}
For multi-threaded execution, we get interesting results. for the smaller image (small.jpg) we see that insertion sort performs the best, but that all algorithms got at least a 2x performance increase. As the data set gets larger, we see that std::sort is out performing bubblesort by a significant margin and insertion sort to a lesser extent. This was predicted initially due to the nature of std:sort.m
\newline
As we increase the Thread count, we start to notice that the overhead of threads is already becoming significant and that adding more power to the problem is being bottlenecked by the time it takes to create these threads. Again, this was as expected as the time to create the threads when the data set is small (as in small.jpg) becomes significant. In the larger data sets we see sight improvements, but they are negligible. This is due to the fact that the test system is limited to 2 Physical cores at any given time and that new threads will not add any benefit if they are also just waiting.

\subsubsection{Partitioning Method}
Looking at Table V, we see that some improvements are there but are negligible in the long run. For extremely large images, square partitioning shows improvements. but these images are unlikely in normal use.

\subsubsection{Speed-up vs Golden Standard}
Regardless of number of threads, partitioning or algorithm used. It is clear that any multi-threaded implementation offered significant speed up. Looking at Table IV, we see that for small datasets, the insertion sort is faster. It should also be noted that insertion sort works best on partially sorted data or data that does not deviate much which is true with regards to small.jpg. std::sort dominates when the data sets get larger and outperforms Insertion sort constantly.\\
